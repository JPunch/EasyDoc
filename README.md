# EasyDoc - Documentation done right

Early WIP work on a simple documentation generator with no faf.


## Development setup

Python package management using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

* Install poetry (choose method from [website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))
* From within the top level directory run `poetry install`

To generate a site from the `example.json` run `python easydoc/easydoc.py`, the results will be in the `site` directory.
